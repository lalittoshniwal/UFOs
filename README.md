# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis was to present the UFO siting data on a webpage using dynamic table. The webpage allowed the users to interact with the data by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results:
In order to use the filters, the users should input the search criteria in the field they would like filter. After they have typed the expected filter, just click outside of the search box. The table will automatically filter. See the screen shots below:

## Summary: 
I was able to successfully set-up the webpage with dynamic table. Unfortunately, the filters currently do not support input in a different case i.e. everything has to be typed in lower case. My recommendation would be to update the code to allow for user to type in any case and behind the scene convert the input to lower case. Another recommendation would be to include instructions for filtering the data when users hover over the filter fields.
